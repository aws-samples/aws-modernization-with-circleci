# Introduction

In this section, we are going to discuss the tasks and items, such as retrieving access tokens and other configurations within some of the integration services listed in the prerequisites section of this workshop. We will also demonstrate how to setup GitHub project repositories with the CircleCI platform so it can detect code changes and trigger your CI/CD pipeline.
