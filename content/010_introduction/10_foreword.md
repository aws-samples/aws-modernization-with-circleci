## The nature of software development has fundamentally changed 

Teams and organizations are releasing code at a record breaking pace and only getting faster. This is primarily attributed to these teams adopting and implementing modern concepts and practices, such as Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration/Deployments (CI/CD) and DevOps into their software development processes. These modern concepts enable teams to better align development and delivery efforts resulting in teams collaborating around code and an increased awareness among collaborators no matter their role. 

These practices and principles require automation to perform tasks consistently, reliably and quickly. Enter CircleCI, a continuous delivery solution meeting developers where they are, bringing robust, powerful, easy to use automation; enabling developers to easily automate their manual tasks, bring continuous delivery practices to life and focus on what really matters which is quickly releasing quality code at scale.
