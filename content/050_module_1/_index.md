# Introduction

In this section, we are going to be leveraging automation to continuously test and verify our code for coverage and security. We will be leverage some third party tools such as CodeCov and FOSSA to implement pipelines that allow us to setup coverage analysis and security scans. 

After we do this, we are going to setup static hosting on AWS S3 and automate a deployment to our bucket with CircleCI.
